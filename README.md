# Personal Portfolio Website – Static HTML/CSS Project

## Project Overview

This project represents a personal portfolio website developed entirely using core front-end technologies: **HTML5** and **CSS3**. The site is structured into six distinct sections, each carefully designed to demonstrate best practices in content organization and user interface (UI) styling.

The main objective of this project was to create a digital portfolio that effectively combines functionality with a clean, professional design, ensuring intuitive navigation across all pages.

   A biographical section that uses grid-based layouts to present personal interests, along with an embedded interactive map (Google Maps via iframe).

3. **CV (cv.html):**
   A structured presentation of academic background and technical skills, organized in a clear and easy-to-read format.

4. **Gallery (galerie.html):**
   A photo album demonstrating image handling techniques and alignment within a modern layout.

5. **Projects (proiecte.html):**
   A detailed overview of completed projects and resources used, including date input elements for better organization.
